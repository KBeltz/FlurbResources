##Tutorials that didn't work because of old data or missing information
**Ember + Rails**
* http://ember.vicramon.com/ => this is old 2014
* https://dockyard.com/blog/2014/05/07/building-an-ember-app-with-rails-part-1 => Attempted but my demo ran into errors

**Rails API**
* https://blog.codeship.com/building-a-json-api-with-rails-5/ => written in 2015, stops in various places just weird order and hard to follow
* http://sourcey.com/building-the-prefect-rails-5-api-only-app/ => nothing visual to see hard to follow along with no way to verify itâ€™s being done right 
* http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/api_app.html => not easy to follow
